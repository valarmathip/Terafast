ncclient: Python library for NETCONF clients
--------------------------------------------

ncclient is a Python library that facilitates client-side scripting and
application development around the NETCONF protocol. ``ncclient`` was
developed by `Shikar Bhushan <http://schmizz.net>`_. It is now
maintained by `Leonidas Poulopoulos (@leopoul) <http://ncclient.org/ncclient>`_

Docs:
`http://ncclient.readthedocs.org <http://ncclient.readthedocs.org>`_

Requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Python 2.6 <= version < 3.0
-  setuptools 0.6+
-  Paramiko 1.7+
-  lxml 3.0+
-  libxml2
-  libxslt

If you are on Debian/Ubuntu install the following libs (via aptitude or
apt-get):

-  libxml2-dev
-  libxslt1-dev

Installation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [ncclient] $ sudo python setup.py install

or via pip:

::

    pip install ncclient

Examples:
^^^^^^^^^

::

    [ncclient] $ python examples/juniper/*.py

Usage
~~~~~

Get device running config
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Use either an interactive Python console (ipython) or integrate the
following in your code:

::

    from ncclient import manager

    with manager.connect(host=host, port=830, username=user, hostkey_verify=False) as m:
        c = m.get_config(source='running').data_xml
        with open("%s.xml" % host, 'w') as f:
            f.write(c)

As of 0.4.1 ncclient integrates Juniper's and Cisco's forks, lots of new concepts
have been introduced that ease management of Juniper and Cisco devices respectively.
The biggest change is the introduction of device handlers in connection paramms.
For example to invoke Juniper's functions annd params one has to re-write the above with 
**device\_params={'name':'junos'}**:

::

    from ncclient import manager

    with manager.connect(host=host, port=830, username=user, hostkey_verify=False, device_params={'name':'junos'}) as m:
        c = m.get_config(source='running').data_xml
        with open("%s.xml" % host, 'w') as f:
            f.write(c)

Device handlers are easy to implement and prove to be futureproof.

Supported device handlers
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Juniper: device_params={'name':'junos'}
* Cisco CSR: device_params={'name':'csr'}
* Cisco Nexus: device_params={'name':'nexus'}
* Huawei: device_params={'name':'huawei'}
* Alcatel Lucent: device_params={'name':'alu'}
* H3C: device_params={'name':'h3c'}
* HP Comware: device_params={'name':'hpcomware'}
